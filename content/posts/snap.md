With the increasing number of connected devices, the need to make more informed compute workload scheduling and orchestration decisions is critical. It is strategically important that telemetry data be exposed with reduced friction to the existing and emerging cloud and data center decision systems (e.g. schedulers) so that they can make the most informed decisions possible. The work demonstrated in this session introduces snap a modern framework for collecting, processing and publishing telemetry data. The solution is meant to have a wide audience, appealing to anyone interested in consuming, producing or processing metric and telemetry data.
